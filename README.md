# Inventory-Raw-Material-Analysis-using-Excel

📦 Inventory Stock Level & Usage Analysis using SQL (MySQL)
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing inventory stock levels and material usage using MySQL Workbench. The objective is to help businesses monitor inventory health, track material consumption, and make data-driven decisions to improve stock management and operational efficiency.

Using structured SQL queries, raw inventory data is transformed into meaningful insights such as current stock status, usage trends, and potential risks of overstocking or stock shortages.
